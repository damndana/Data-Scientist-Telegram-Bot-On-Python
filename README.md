# Data-Scientist-Telegram-Bot-On-Python
This bot has 3 files in it:bot.py,gpt.py,util.py. Bot has 3 important and featured commands. They are:start,gpt,quiz,whatsup.
Start is just a regular command to give general information.
Gpt command uses ChatGPT OpenAI API that is prompted in my code to give advices and answer questions as a Senior Data Scientist.
Next one is quiz command.It generates quizzes on data science and AI topic and sends it to a user with multiple choice and then shows the right answer.
Last one is whatsup command that sends all the news from world of IT,AI,DS,ML and etc. 
In my code I used various telegram framework libraries and also openai library tooðŸ”Œ
